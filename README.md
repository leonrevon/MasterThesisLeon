# Master Thesis Leon

Uses  [*AR Foundation 4.0*](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arfoundation@4.0/manual/index.html) 

The following library has been used for this repository:

* Unity Google Drive ([link](https://github.com/Elringus/UnityGoogleDrive))
* UniGLTF ([link](https://github.com/ousttrue/UniGLTF))

See also (Not in this repo, for external analysis of point cloud):
* Open3D ([link](http://www.open3d.org/))

The Master Thesis is about using Augmented Reality to track construction progress.

The 3D CAD Model is superimposed on the real world object by implement image tracking based on marker. This is done by comparing the 3D CAD Model with the real world object.
The image is the 3D CAD Model used in this work.

There are two scene in this work, point cloud scene and meshing scene (Using LiDAR).
In Point Cloud scene, the application will track the feature points of the object of interest.
